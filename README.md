# SOC and SOH Estimation for Batteries
## Overview
State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH) estimation are crucial for battery management, especially in electric vehicles and energy storage systems. SOC measures the remaining charge in a battery, while SOH tracks its aging and capacity loss over time.
